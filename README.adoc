 and work for securing better grades.

* College students issue:
** When visiting other college locally or overseas, your exchange program will have meetings and trips where you get to
meet new friends around the world. Now that you have made friends and get along well, you might wish to save these
information on a single platform solely build for the purpose of easy accessibility to their personal information.
** While using other methods to save these information are great (e.g. Mobile phone), however, adding massive information
through the standard click and type method, may seem to be too slow and inefficient.
** Sleep deprivation are common among college student who opt for entertainment (e.g. making new friends, travelling) and
securing good grades.

* Solutions:
** iungo specifically targets these young adults who are more adept at using the keyboard, and prefers adding contacts solely
with the keyboard, rather than using a mouse. As a result, most of the available commands can be done using just a keyboard.
** iungo understood that college students often have to endure countless sleepless night, hence, iungo specifically enable
GUi adjustment that is suitable for the already fatigue and tired eyes.
